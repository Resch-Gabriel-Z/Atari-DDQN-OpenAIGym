# Atari-DDQN-OpenAIGym

An implementation of the Double Deep Q-Learning Network with methods, hyperparameters and 
architecture presented in the Paper by van Hasselt et al. 2015 ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461))

# Games
As a Benchmark I will use 15 Atari Games were the AI in the paper got particularly good results.
A list can be found [here](https://github.com/Resch-Gabriel-Z/Atari-DDQN-OpenAIGym/blob/main/Game_Name_combo.txt)

# Results
Sadly I currently cannot provide any results as my resources for training are very limited and won't be able to compete
with the demand a single Atari Game would need, let alone 15.

As soon as I have more capacities, I will update this repo with results. 
I'll make sure to provide some nice looking graphs and gifs :)
